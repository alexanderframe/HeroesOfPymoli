While there are more males than females playing the game (484 male users to 81 female users), the average female user made more purchases than their male counterpart as well as spending more per purchase.  
Considering the large amount of male users compared to female users and overall gaming demographics in general, perhaps there were more males that just gave the game a try but did not fully invest into it, while female users that played Heroes of Pymoli might have had a more vested interest and would be more willing to spend money in game.


When looking at the purchasing analysis based on age, the breakdown of who spent what resembled what I expected after choosing the age ranges that I did.
Kids that are 15 years old or younger were near the bottom of average money spent on the game.  This makes sense as kids in this age range would usually have less money than people in the older age ranges.
It also makes sense that people aged 16-20 would spend the most on the game.  While usually they would have less money than those older than them, they also have less bills/responsibility and would have more room in their "budget" for spending money on games.
After the 16-20 age range, each successive age range spent less and less money on the game. One factors this could be due to is that as people get older, they (usually) get more responsible with their money and have more bills/responsibility, as well as less time to play games (unfortunately).

The most popular items in terms of Purchase Count seemed to be items that were on the pricier side.  This makes sense to me, as more expensive items are usually going to be very good in-game, while it is probably easier to find items in-game that are comparable to the cheaper items that you can buy.
Also, the more profitable items just sound cooler.  I mean, "Shadow Strike, Glory of Ending Hope"? That's just a bad-ass name.
