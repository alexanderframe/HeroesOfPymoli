Solution for "Heroes of Pymoli" can be found in the "afHeroesOfPymoli" Jupyter notebook file.
The written description of three observable trends portion of the assignment can be found in the 'Trends.md' file.

Calculations and created dataframes were made according to the instructions in README.md located in the general Instructions folder of the pandas homework folder.  Therefore, some dataframes do not match what the "instructions" within the Jupyter notebook file ask for.  
Such differences include the "Most Popular Items" section of the Jupyter notebook asking to sort all items in descending order of purchase count, whereas the general Instructions readme asks for only the top 5 purchased items.

This was a challenging assignment, but a lot of fun.  There must be a better, more efficient way of doing the Age and Gender demographics and analysis, but I couldn't figure it out.  I tried making functions where you would pass in the age-range or gender you were looking for, but it ended up breaking my code and I settled on typing it out for each gender/age.  I look forward to the solution being posted and seeing a quicker way to do it.
